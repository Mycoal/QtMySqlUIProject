# QtMySqlUIProject
This is a Qt application for users to interact with MySql database.
Throughout the development of this project I will design pages for users to enter information into the databse..
As well as an admin and guest account for users to dedicate certain features to only certain users.

I hope to implement a fair amount of stored procedures for admins use only.

UPDATE - Project is finished. In the future I may include stored procedures but have not yet.
	
To implement this project for yourself, you would need to either follow my querys and design a mysql database with the same tables and columns, or change my querys to fit your own.
To even gain access to any window besides login, you will need a login table with username "guest", and password "guest", or username "admin", and password "admin".
